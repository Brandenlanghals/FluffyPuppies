                <p class="card_text">Fluffy Puppies is a mock business owned by my uncle Randy. He wanted to create a straightforward website to help give his current customers more information about his business and its values, as well as provide information for potential new customers. 
                  I have created a site that is clean and simple and answers the intended questions for his customers such as service details, business hours, contact information, frequently asked questions, reviews, and pictures of clients. </p>

                <p class="card_text">This information was provided using HTML, CSS, tables, photos, video, and a little bit of JavaScript. The colors are neutral and earthy, to match the tone of a business where animals are the clientele. 
                  Each page was built with the intention of being simple, and welcoming. Except for the cursive font used, they fonts chosen are among the easiest to read, and convey their message simplistically. 
                  The cursive font was used for headers and added a touch of elegance which is reflective of the royal treatment the pets will receive during grooming.

                <p class="card_text">There is a lot of room for improvement since a site is never 100% complete. If I were given more time I would like to add a functional form for booking online, 
                  and demonstrate this feature by utilizing local storage, and storing user information then appending it to the page. I would also most likely consolidate this to one scrolling page and not have each page be separate. 
                  I feel like this is a business that is simple enough to put everything in one place, but I went too far in this format before realizing the scope of what it really is. I would also reformat to be mobile responsive. </p>
